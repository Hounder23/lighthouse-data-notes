### Project-Specific Directories

Throughout the program, we will complete various projects. Setting up each project in its own sub-directory will allow you to stay organized - a key competency of a data professional.

For the projects that are evaluated, your GitHub repo will be used to submit your project. You will also be evaluated on the organization of your repo. 

> #### Note
> Before you start on your first project, youâ€™ll be given an example of the organization required in your GitHub repo.

Here are a few tips for organizing your project repos:

- Create separate folders for different projects
- Separate data files from code
- Organize code by features and types

## Conclusion

As mentioned, being organized is a key competency of a data professional. Something as simple as keeping an intuitive folder structure for your projects and their respective code will support you as you progress through this program and in creating a portfolio of your own projects.
